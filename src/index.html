                                    web applications. The problem is that all of those lines of JavaScript code can slow
                                    down your apps. This book reveals techniques and strategies to help you eliminate performance
                                    bottlenecks during development. You'll learn how to improve execution time, downloading,

                                    JavaScript may be the most essential web programming language, but in the real world, JavaScript applications often break
                                    when you make changes. With this book, author Eric Elliott shows you how to add client-
                                    and server-side features to a large JavaScript application without negatively affecting
                                    the rest of your code.

                                <p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share
                                    of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined.
                                    This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript
                                    that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset
                                    you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>
                                <p>Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas
                                    Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding
                                    object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects,
                                    and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed
                                    in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.</p>
                                <p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its
                                    popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language.
                                    In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good
                                    intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts
